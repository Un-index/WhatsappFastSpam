### A fast and **very** easy to use spam tool for WhatsApp.


the only dependency it uses is [playwright](https://playwright.dev/), to automate Chromium

### usage
###### before continuing ensure you've installed Node; for e.g very simply via the installer: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
open your terminal and type
```
npm i whatsappfastspam
```

run it (note you must use double quotes for Windows, this works on both Windows and Linux)
```
node -e "require('whatsappfastspam')"
```
and follow the prompts in the console

#### Next, **You will need your phone** to scan the displayed QR code, but after that everything happens on its own.
#### NOTE: ensure you type the name **exactly** as it appears in your contacts list on WhatsApp for it to be recognized
