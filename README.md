the only dependency it uses is [playwright](https://playwright.dev/), to automate Chromium

### usage
open your terminal and type
```

```

run it (note you must use double quotes for Windows, this works on both Windows and Linux)
```
node -e "require('whatsappfastspam')"
```
and follow the prompts in the console

#### You will need your phone to scan the displayed QR code, but after that everything happens on its own.
